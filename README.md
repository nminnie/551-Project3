The networks are run in Google Colab to take advantage of the GPU.

On Google Drive, the folder structure should be
- My Drive
  - Colab Notebooks
    - dataset
      - input
        - train
          - train_images.pkl
          - train_labels.csv
        - test
          - test_images.pkl
    - CNN_6.ipynb
    - CNN_7_BN.ipynb
    - ResNet.ipynb
    - VGG16.ipynb

Each notebook contains a neural network. You can run them individually.
